I separated the positive and negative image folders as they were too big to upload. The full version of the project is available on the VLE Final Project Report Submissions Page.

Steps to use the App:

1. Install Pycharm or load Visual studio
2. Open the project folder in that
3. Run app.py file
4. You will see link http://127.0.0.1:5000 so click on it or you can copy and paste on your default browser
5. Upload the image and check the prediction
