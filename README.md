I separated the positive and negative image folders as they were too big to upload. The full version of the project is available on the VLE.

Steps to use the App:

1. Install Pycharm or load Visual studio
2. Open the project folder in that
3. Run app.py file
4. You will see link http://127.0.0.1:5000 so click on it or you can copy and paste on your default browser
5. Upload the image and check the prediction
